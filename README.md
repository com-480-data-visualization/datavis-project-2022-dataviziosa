# PotterViz
## Motivation
## Deliverables
- The goal of the [first milestone](pdf/milestone1.md) was to define the project and perform an [exploratory data analysis](python/exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb). 
- In the second [second milestone](pdf/milestone2.md), we are asked to give more details about the visualisations we want to make. The basic website skeleton can be found [here](https://com-480-data-visualization.github.io/datavis-project-2022-dataviziosa/)
